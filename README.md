## Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript Data Fetching

The time taken to fetch data from a server depends on many factors and hence it can vary considerably. If an app becomes unresponsive while the data is being fetched, it is definitely an example of bad User Experience (or UX for short). This happens due to synchronous data fetching.

To resolve this issue, the app should use asynchronous data fetching. [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a popular JavaScript library used to make asynchronous HTTP requests or XMLHttpRequests.

Axios is being used in this project to demonstrate fetching data from a *reddit* feed asynchronously. Once the JSON data is received, it can be used within the app as required. The site is deployed on *Surge* [at this link](http://fetch-data.surge.sh/)
